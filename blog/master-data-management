# Master Data Management Tool

See this tool in action. (Add demo link or screenshots to illustrate usage.)

This Master Data Management (MDM) tool is built in Oracle Application Express (APEX). It provides a full set of data management capabilities focused on importing, validating, correcting and exporting business data — all through a browser-based interface.

---

## Overview

The application is designed for operational data stewards and administrators who need to keep master data clean, consistent and auditable. Using APEX for the UI and Oracle for the data layer makes the solution lightweight to deploy (works on Oracle XE or any Oracle DB with APEX) while offering enterprise-grade validation and reporting.

---

## Key Features

- Data import/export using CSV files — bulk load and extract data for integration or offline processing  
- Business rules management — define and store validation rules for your master data domains  
- Business rules validation runs — execute rules against datasets and capture results for review  
- Validation error charts and dashboards — visualise data-quality issues using APEX reporting and charts  
- Data management operations — perform update, delete and insert actions for cleaning and harmonising business data

---

## Typical Workflows

1. Prepare source data as CSV and upload it to the system.  
2. Run validation against configured business rules (duplicates, required fields, value ranges, formats).  
3. Review validation results on dashboards and charts; drill into individual records.  
4. Apply corrections manually or via bulk operations (update/insert/delete).  
5. Export cleansed data for downstream systems or final load.

---

## Technical Notes

- Platform: Oracle APEX (web front-end)  
- Database: Oracle Database (Oracle XE recommended for quick testing)  
- Data transport: CSV import/export (server-side processing)  
- Reporting: APEX Interactive Reports / Charts for validation and metrics  
- Security: Use APEX authentication and role-based authorization to control edit/access to data management functions

---

## Deployment & Installation (high level)

1. Provision an Oracle Database with APEX (Oracle XE for evaluation).  
2. Run provided DDL to create schema objects (tables, sequences, procedures).  
3. Import the APEX application export (Application Builder → Import).  
4. Configure file-storage/directories, database privileges and APEX authentication.  
5. Test with a sample CSV, run the validation, and inspect the dashboard.

---

## Benefits

- Faster detection and correction of data quality issues  
- Centralised rules and auditable validation runs  
- Lightweight deployment using APEX for rapid customization  
- Business-friendly dashboards for stakeholders and data stewards

---

## Next Steps

- Add demo screenshots or a short screencast link under "See this tool in action."  
- Provide sample DDL and an importable APEX export for quick evaluation.  
- Expand the rules engine to support rule-versioning and scheduled validation runs.

If you’d like, I can generate a ready-to-run DDL script and a short installation checklist tailored for Oracle XE, or produce the APEX export-ready README. Tell me which you prefer next.
