# 🚗 Car Dealer Web Application – Build, Advertise, and Sell with Ease

Buying or selling a car online should be simple, transparent, and fast — that’s the idea behind my **Car Dealer Web Application**.  

This project demonstrates a fully functional **web platform for vehicle listings**, where **any user can register, list their cars for sale, and include detailed specifications and photos**. It’s designed to be flexible, reusable, and easily adapted for other domains such as **real estate listings**, **equipment marketplaces**, or **dealer-specific platforms**.
