Integrating FTIR Spectroscopy Data into ERP Workflows
---

Modern laboratories and manufacturing environments produce a huge amount of analytical data. Yet, most of this information remains **isolated** inside instruments — never making it into the organization's **ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)** system, where it could drive quality decisions, traceability, and automation.

In this project, I built a complete workflow that connects **FTIR spectroscopy** data with an **ERP backend**, using Python as the bridge between scientific measurements and enterprise systems.

The result is an end-to-end pipeline capable of:

- Loading FTIR spectra  
- Preprocessing and smoothing  
- Detecting deviations from reference material  
- Projecting data with PCA  
- Classifying samples (PASS/FAIL or ML prediction)  
- Sending QC results into an ERP API

# 🔬 What Is FTIR Spectroscopy?

**FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy)** is a method for identifying chemical substances by measuring how they absorb infrared light.

Common uses include:

- Polymer identification  
- Incoming raw material quality checks  
- Contamination detection  
- Batch-to-batch consistency verification  

Each material has a **unique spectral fingerprint**, which can be compared against a reference spectrum.

# 🏭 Why Integrate FTIR with ERP?

ERP systems maintain:

- Material master data  
- Batch records  
- Supplier info  
- Manufacturing execution workflows  

However, FTIR results often stay locked inside software like OMNIC, Spectrum, or OPUS.

By integrating FTIR→ERP, organizations can:

- Approve or reject raw materials automatically  
- Trigger workflows based on spectral deviations  
- Generate QC reports without human entry  
- Improve traceability across the supply chain  
- Strengthen compliance with ISO & GMP standards

# 📥 Loading FTIR Data (CSV Format)

The FTIR instrument (or exported files) provides spectra like:

```

wavenumber,absorbance
4000,0.02
3950,0.02
...
1600,1.32
...

````

I created a dataset with:

- `reference_material.csv` — ground truth spectrum  
- `sample_good.csv` — within acceptable deviation  
- `sample_bad.csv` — clearly out-of-spec  
- `sample_new.csv` — realistic unknown material  

---

# 🧹 Preprocessing FTIR Spectra

Raw spectra often contain:

- Baseline shifts  
- Noise  
- Scaling inconsistencies  

This preprocessing pipeline ensures comparability:

```python
def advanced_preprocess(y):
    y = y - np.min(y)                      # baseline correction
    y = savgol_filter(y, 15, 3)           # smoothing
    return y / np.linalg.norm(y)          # normalization
````

# 📊 Visualizing Spectra

Here is an overlay of the processed spectra:

# 📐 PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

PCA compresses high-dimensional FTIR data into 2D for visualization:

![FTIR PCA clusters](/assets/images/ftir_pca_clusters.png)

---

# 🧪 PASS/FAIL Logic Using RMS Error

A simple and effective QC metric is RMS difference from the reference:

```python
error = rms_error(reference, sample)
status = "PASS" if error <= 0.05 else "FAIL"
```

This produces output like:

```
sample_good.csv → PASS
sample_bad.csv → FAIL
sample_new.csv → PASS
```

---

# 🤖 ML Classifier (SVM)

For more advanced classification, I trained an SVM:

```python
clf = SVC(kernel="rbf", gamma="scale")
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
prediction = clf.predict([new_spectrum])[0]
```

This allows:

* Multi-class classification
* Detection of subtle variation
* Improved generalization to new materials

---

# 🌐 Sending Results to ERP (FastAPI)

I built a mock ERP API:

```python
@app.post("/erp/ftir_report")
def receive_ftir_report(report: FTIRReport):
    print("ERP received QC report:")
    print(report)
```

And from the FTIR pipeline:

```python
payload = {
    "sample_name": "sample_new.csv",
    "rms_error": 0.034,
    "status": "PASS"
}
requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/erp/ftir_report", json=payload)
```

ERP responds:

```
{"message": "Report stored in ERP", "received": true}
```
